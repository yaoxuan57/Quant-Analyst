The production of any item outside the State of Washington is not\\ncovered by RCW 39.12.\\n1. Is the item fabricated for a public works project? If not, it is not subject to RCW\\n39.12. If it is, go to question 2.\\n2. Is the item fabricated on the public works jobsite? If it is, the work is covered under\\nRCW 39.12. If not, go to question 3.\\n3. Is the item fabricated in an assembly/fabrication plant set up for, and dedicated\\nprimarily to, the public works project? If it is, the work is covered by RCW 39.12. If not,\\ngo to question 4.\\n4. Does the item require any assembly, cutting, modification or other fabrication by the\\nsupplier? If not, the work is not covered by RCW 39.12. If yes, go to question 5.\\n5. Is the prefabricated item intended for the public works project typically an inventory\\nitem which could reasonably be sold on the general market?

For example, travel time spent returning to a supply source to obtain\\nanother load of material for use on a public works site or returning to the public works\\nsite to obtain another load of excavated material is time spent in travel that is subject to\\nprevailing wage. Travel to a supply source, including travel from a public works site, to\\nobtain materials for use on a private project would not be travel subject to the prevailing\\nwage.\\n(4) Workers are not subject to the provisions of chapter 39.12 RCW when they deliver\\nmaterials to a stockpile.\\n(a) A \"stockpile\" is defined as materials delivered to a pile located away from the site\\nof incorporation such that the stockpiled materials must be physically moved from the\\nstockpile and transported to another location on the project site in order to be\\nincorporated into the project.\\n(b) A stockpile does not include any of the functions described in subsection (2)(a)\\nthrough (f) of this section; nor does a stockpile include materials delivered or distributed\\nto multiple locations upon the project site; nor does a stockpile include materials dumped\\nat the place of incorporation, or adjacent to the location and coordinated with the\\nincorporation.\\n(5) The applicable prevailing wage rate shall be determined by the locality in which\\nthe work is performed.
